Consider the following statements about the functionality of an IP based router.

I. A router does not modify the IP packets during forwarding.
II. It is not necessary for a router to implement any routing protocol.
III. A router should reassemble IP fragments if the MTU of the outgoing link is larger than the size of the incoming IP packet.

Which of the above statements is/are TRUE?

II only is the answer. Because a router must implement a routing protocol to forward packets. 
It is not necessary that it should implement all routing protocols. It can implement only one or two routing protocols. 
But it must implement at least one routing protocol.
