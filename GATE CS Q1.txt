1) An organization has a class B network and wishes to form subnets for 64 departments. The subnet mask would be:
(a) 255.255.0.0
(b) 255.255.64.0
(c) 255.255.128.0
(d) 255.255.252.0

Answer (d)
The size of network ID is 16 bit in class B networks. So bits after 16th bit must be used to create 64 departments. Total 6 bits are needed to identify 64 different departments. 
=> FF.FF.11111100.00 is the solution

Therefore, subnet mask will be 255.255.252.0.
